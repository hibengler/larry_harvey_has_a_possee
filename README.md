Larry Harvey has a Possee / Robot Hater Invaders.
By Hipolito Medrano  - Artist.  And Hibbard Engler - developer.

LGPL 2.0

Due to the death of Larry Harvey, founder of Burning Man, Hipolity Medrano decided to gift his Robot Hater Invaders stickers to the world:"So, I'm giving every Burner consent to use one of the following Robot Hater Invaders" for the purposes of honoring Larry Harvey, and TTITD thats changed my life."


For Hib, Burning Man and Larry Harvey are a big part of who he is, as well.So the idea is to make little icons with Raylib - these will run on their own. Also they will be incorporated into a visualizer in silent radiance.  

We will start with initial images and at the end have a nice library and raylib app.
